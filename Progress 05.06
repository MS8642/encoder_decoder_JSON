# Please note that currently most of the modifications are made in the 
# "encode" section.

# A little trouble has been identified.
# After the text in the text file
# "Testing.txt" has been formed into
# a list the printed result 
# showed this:

  ['Johny 30 null\n', 'Brad 18 Chevrolet']

# The letter n with a dash at the end
# signifies that string[1]
# is on the new line which is correct:

  Johny 30 null 
  Brad 18 Chevrolet

# It can pose to be an obstacle for the main idea however
# and this code has helped to remove the n:

  lst = [i.split('\n', 1)[0] for i in lst]

# thus giving this output:

  ['Johny 30 null', 'Brad 18 Chevrolet']

# which is correct.
