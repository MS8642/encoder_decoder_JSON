# A note of thought

# It is better to concentrate for now on
# a simpler model of the code
# and later to transform
# it to a more complicated version.

# That is, not to transform 
# the text files to JSON format just yet,
# and to continue working in text format.
# When the code blueprint for text files will be done,
# it will be simpler to do it in JSON format.
