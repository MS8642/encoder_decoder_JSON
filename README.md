# encoder_decoder_JSON
# A program that creates a custom JSON encoder and decoder for complex Python objects.

# Example of a JSON string
'{"name":"John", "age":30, "car":null}'

# Encoder - An encoder is a function that takes a value type A and returns a CharSequence
# that represents the encoded value (JSON String).

# The function starts here:

boolean("Would you like to encode files?")
  answer yes, goes to inp variable
  answer no, goes to next boolean

inp = input(somefile)

def encoder_starts_here
.
.
.
print (or otherwise show) a (new?) encoded file.

boolean ("Would you like to decode files?")
  answer yes, goes to outp variable
  answer no, goes to finish variable

outp = input(somefile)

def decoder_starts_here
.
.
.
print( or otherwise show) a (new?) decoded file.

finish = print("Thank you for using this prog".)
end
